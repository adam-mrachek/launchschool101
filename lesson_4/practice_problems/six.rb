# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# Answer
# The return value is `11` because `#pop` returns the last element of an array (after removing it from the array).
# In this case, the string 'caterpillar' is the last element and calling `#size` on it returns 11.
